# SynapticWeave: Evolving Differentiable Procedural Generation

Unleashing emergent AI behavior and compositional latent space exploration through adversarial networks and differentiable procedural generation.

SynapticWeave is a cutting-edge research project exploring the intersection of differentiable procedural content generation (DPCG) and adversarial networks. It aims to create a system where procedural generators, represented as neural networks, can be evolved and refined through interaction with an adversarial network acting as a critic. This approach enables the generation of complex and nuanced content, driven by a learned understanding of desired properties, rather than explicit programming. The project is designed to foster emergent AI behavior by allowing the generator to discover novel and unexpected solutions in its pursuit of fooling the discriminator.

The core principle revolves around using the adversarial loss as a training signal for the procedural generator. The generator learns to produce content that not only resembles a target distribution (defined implicitly by the discriminator) but also exhibits desirable characteristics that promote compositional understanding within its latent space. This compositional understanding allows for smooth interpolation and manipulation of generated content, opening avenues for applications in game development, art generation, and data augmentation. The differentiable nature of the generator allows for gradient-based optimization, enabling fine-grained control over the generated output and facilitating the exploration of the vast possibilities within the latent space.

SynapticWeave differentiates itself through its emphasis on continuous evolution and latent space exploration. Instead of relying on pre-defined rules or hardcoded parameters, the system learns to generate content based on the feedback provided by the discriminator. This learning process allows the generator to adapt to new challenges and produce increasingly sophisticated outputs. Furthermore, the compositional latent space enables users to easily manipulate and combine different aspects of the generated content, creating a powerful tool for creative exploration. The use of TypeScript ensures a robust and maintainable codebase, facilitating collaboration and future development.

Key Features

*   **Differentiable Procedural Generators:** Implemented using neural networks with architectures suitable for generating various types of content (e.g., images, levels, textures). The network weights are optimized using gradient descent, enabling precise control over the generated output. The generator is typically a convolutional neural network (CNN) or a generative adversarial network (GAN) component.
*   **Adversarial Training Loop:** A discriminator network evaluates the generated content and provides feedback to the generator. The discriminator is trained to distinguish between real and generated samples, while the generator is trained to fool the discriminator. This adversarial process drives the evolution of the generator and enhances the quality of the generated content. The loss functions are carefully crafted to encourage both realism and diversity.
*   **Compositional Latent Space:** The latent space of the generator is designed to be compositional, allowing for meaningful interpolation and manipulation of generated content. Techniques like disentanglement learning and variational autoencoders (VAEs) are employed to promote the emergence of independent and interpretable factors within the latent space.
*   **Evolving Architectures:** The project explores the possibility of evolving the architecture of the generator network over time using techniques like neural architecture search (NAS). This allows the system to automatically discover optimal architectures for generating specific types of content.
*   **TypeScript Implementation:** The entire project is written in TypeScript, providing static typing and improved code maintainability. This ensures type safety and facilitates collaboration among developers.
*   **Modular Design:** The codebase is designed with modularity in mind, allowing for easy extension and modification. The different components of the system (e.g., generator, discriminator, training loop) are implemented as separate modules with well-defined interfaces.
*   **Customizable Training Parameters:** The training process is highly customizable, allowing users to adjust various parameters such as learning rate, batch size, and the architecture of the networks.

Technology Stack

*   **TypeScript:** The primary programming language used for development, providing static typing and improved code maintainability.
*   **TensorFlow.js:** A JavaScript library for training and deploying machine learning models in the browser and on Node.js. Used for implementing the neural networks and training loops.
*   **Node.js:** A JavaScript runtime environment used for running the server-side components of the project.
*   **Webpack:** A module bundler used for packaging the TypeScript code and dependencies into deployable bundles.
*   **Jest:** A JavaScript testing framework used for unit testing and integration testing.

Installation

1.  Clone the repository:
    git clone https://github.com/jjfhwang/SynapticWeave.git
2.  Navigate to the project directory:
    cd SynapticWeave
3.  Install the dependencies:
    npm install
4.  Build the project:
    npm run build

Configuration

The project utilizes environment variables for configuration. Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project and define the following variables:

*   `GENERATOR_ARCHITECTURE`: Specifies the architecture of the generator network (e.g., "CNN", "GAN").
*   `DISCRIMINATOR_ARCHITECTURE`: Specifies the architecture of the discriminator network (e.g., "CNN").
*   `LATENT_DIMENSION`: The dimensionality of the latent space.
*   `LEARNING_RATE`: The learning rate used for training the networks.
*   `BATCH_SIZE`: The batch size used for training.
*   `TRAINING_EPOCHS`: The number of training epochs.

You can also configure these variables directly in the `config.ts` file if preferred.

Usage

To run the training process:

node dist/train.js

This will start the training loop and output the progress to the console. The generated content and the trained models will be saved in the `output` directory.

Example code snippet (Node.js):

const generator = new Generator(GENERATOR_ARCHITECTURE, LATENT_DIMENSION);
const discriminator = new Discriminator(DISCRIMINATOR_ARCHITECTURE);
const trainer = new Trainer(generator, discriminator, LEARNING_RATE, BATCH_SIZE);

trainer.train(TRAINING_EPOCHS);

Detailed API documentation will be made available separately.
