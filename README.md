# SynapticWeave: A Decentralized Knowledge Graph Construction and Querying Framework

SynapticWeave is a TypeScript-based framework designed for building and querying decentralized knowledge graphs. It provides a modular and extensible platform for representing, storing, and reasoning about information across distributed systems. This framework is particularly well-suited for applications requiring robust data integration, semantic search, and knowledge discovery in environments where centralized data management is impractical or undesirable. It facilitates the creation of complex relational structures from disparate data sources, enabling powerful insights and advanced analytics.

The core purpose of SynapticWeave is to address the challenges of knowledge integration in decentralized settings. Traditional knowledge graphs often rely on centralized databases, which can become bottlenecks and points of failure. SynapticWeave overcomes these limitations by leveraging peer-to-peer communication and distributed storage mechanisms. It allows nodes in the network to contribute and access knowledge independently, fostering a more resilient and scalable knowledge representation. By utilizing cryptographic principles for data integrity and access control, SynapticWeave ensures the reliability and security of the distributed knowledge graph.

SynapticWeave offers a flexible architecture that supports various data models and query languages. It incorporates a modular design, allowing developers to easily extend its functionality with custom data sources, reasoning engines, and query optimization techniques. The framework's API provides intuitive interfaces for creating, updating, and querying the knowledge graph, simplifying the development process for complex knowledge-based applications. The eventual goal is to provide a standardized interface for interacting with knowledge, independent of the underlying data source and storage mechanism.

## Key Features

*   **Decentralized Knowledge Representation:** Utilizes a distributed hash table (DHT) for storing knowledge graph triples across a peer-to-peer network. Each node maintains a partial view of the graph, ensuring resilience and scalability. The DHT implementation is pluggable, allowing for different DHT implementations to be used depending on the use case.
*   **Semantic Data Integration:** Supports various data formats, including RDF, JSON-LD, and custom schemas, enabling the integration of knowledge from diverse sources. Data transformations are handled through configurable mapping rules defined using a TypeScript-based domain specific language (DSL).
*   **Reasoning Engine Integration:** Provides an extensible interface for integrating reasoning engines, such as rule-based reasoners and probabilistic inference systems. This enables advanced knowledge discovery and inference capabilities within the decentralized environment. The framework supports integration with existing reasoners that expose a programmatic API.
*   **Cryptographic Data Integrity:** Employs cryptographic hashing and digital signatures to ensure the integrity and authenticity of knowledge graph data. Each triple is signed by its originator, providing provenance and preventing unauthorized modifications. The cryptographic implementation is based on the Web Cryptography API, enabling support for various cryptographic algorithms.
*   **Query Optimization:** Implements query optimization techniques, such as query rewriting and distributed query planning, to improve query performance in the decentralized environment. The query optimizer analyzes the query structure and the available data to determine the most efficient execution plan.
*   **Access Control:** Supports fine-grained access control policies based on cryptographic identities and attribute-based access control (ABAC). This allows for secure sharing of knowledge within the decentralized network, ensuring that only authorized users can access sensitive information. Access control policies are defined using a declarative language and enforced by the nodes in the network.
*   **TypeScript SDK:** Provides a comprehensive TypeScript SDK for developers to interact with the SynapticWeave framework. The SDK includes APIs for creating, querying, and managing the decentralized knowledge graph. The SDK leverages TypeScript's type system to provide compile-time safety and improve the development experience.

## Technology Stack

*   **TypeScript:** The primary programming language used for developing the SynapticWeave framework. TypeScript provides strong typing and object-oriented features, enabling the creation of robust and maintainable code.
*   **Node.js:** A JavaScript runtime environment used for running the SynapticWeave framework on the server-side. Node.js provides a non-blocking I/O model, making it well-suited for building scalable and distributed applications.
*   **DHT (Distributed Hash Table):** Used for storing knowledge graph triples in a decentralized manner. Currently supports Kademlia as the default implementation.
*   **RDF (Resource Description Framework):** A standard model for data interchange on the Web. SynapticWeave supports RDF as one of its primary data formats.
*   **JSON-LD (JSON for Linked Data):** A JSON-based format for representing linked data. SynapticWeave supports JSON-LD as an alternative data format.
*   **Web Cryptography API:** A JavaScript API for performing cryptographic operations in web browsers and Node.js. SynapticWeave uses the Web Cryptography API for data integrity and access control.

## Installation

1.  **Install Node.js and npm:** Ensure that Node.js (version 16 or higher) and npm (Node Package Manager) are installed on your system. You can download them from the official Node.js website.

2.  **Clone the SynapticWeave repository:** Clone the SynapticWeave repository from GitHub using the following command:

    git clone https://github.com/jjfhwang/SynapticWeave.git

3.  **Navigate to the repository directory:** Change your current directory to the SynapticWeave repository directory:

    cd SynapticWeave

4.  **Install dependencies:** Install the required dependencies using npm:

    npm install

5.  **Build the project:** Compile the TypeScript code into JavaScript using the following command:

    npm run build

## Configuration

SynapticWeave requires several environment variables to be configured properly. These variables can be set in a `.env` file in the root directory of the project.

*   `DHT_PORT`: The port number for the DHT server to listen on (default: 4000).
*   `DHT_BOOTSTRAP_NODE`: The address of a bootstrap node in the DHT network (optional). If not provided, the node will create its own network.
*   `DATA_DIRECTORY`: The directory where the knowledge graph data will be stored (default: ./data).
*   `LOG_LEVEL`: The logging level for the application (default: info).

Example .env file:

DHT_PORT=4000
DHT_BOOTSTRAP_NODE=127.0.0.1:4001
DATA_DIRECTORY=./data
LOG_LEVEL=debug

## Usage

To start a SynapticWeave node:

npm start

This will start a node that participates in the distributed knowledge graph. You can then use the TypeScript SDK to interact with the node and query the knowledge graph.

Example code:

import { SynapticWeaveClient } from './src/client';

const client = new SynapticWeaveClient({
    dhtPort: 4000,
    bootstrapNode: '127.0.0.1:4001'
});

client.connect().then(() => {
    console.log('Connected to SynapticWeave network');
    client.query('SELECT ?s ?p ?o WHERE { ?s ?p ?o . }').then(results => {
        console.log('Query results:', results);
    });
});

(Note: The above code assumes the existence of a SynapticWeaveClient in the `/src/client.ts` file and a functioning implementation of connect() and query().)

API documentation will be located at [LINK TO API DOCS - TO BE GENERATED] once completed.
